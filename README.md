# The variable background of XMM-Newton

This is a page containing the data related to my B.Sc. thesis in Physics at the University of Pavia, that you can view [here](https://it.overleaf.com/read/qzyvtnfmqtqr) in its latest draft.

## References

In this folder you can find some of the bibliography I used in this work.

## Simulations

This folder contains the simulation data from [http://www.srim.org/](SRIM) (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter). It is already ordered for data analysis through ROOT or Python, using 10 000 ions in the range 1-100 keV, 1 000 ions for 100+ keV.

Have a nice navigation :)
